# King-Kong 

What it is?
it is a 3 meter tall robotic kingkong costume which one person can get inside, and control it. This project is done by menbers at Fablab Taipei, and supported by NTSEC. I think it is the very first time we try to make something huge, together. I personally divided this project into to part electrical and none electrical. and here I will skip the non electric part, and only contains the electric part, which mostly, is arduino involved.

For the arduino part, there are three major effect needs to be produced:
1) Facial expression
  - Moving eyes
  - Moving jaw and shouting effects
2) Robotic stepping sound effect
3) Punch lighting

1) Facial expression
The moving eyes part is made by two led array, and for this part we get support and help from OpenLab community a lot. YiHung Cheng is the one who started tinkering with the code.
